The program enables automatic creation of directory structure for scans and repair of file names by downloading necessary information such as series, sub-series, and number of pages from the IZA database. It operates on multiple archival units simultaneously. It has a scan verification module that provides information about scans from different units in the same directory, missing pages based on page counter, missing patterns within a given unit, incorrect DPI, and a search function for incorrect scans (lack of continuity in the counter, empty, too large, or too small margins). The program can automatically crop excessively large margins, correct cover names, sort the counter, and automatically complete metadata according to management requirements, such as entering ICC color profile, adding scanner name, scan name, copyrights, comments, and scanner manufacturer and model with software. Using the IZA database, the program can also automatically create metrics for any number of units. After verifying the scans, the user can create checksums of all scans required to prepare a shipment to NAC. The program has a module responsible for copying scans designated for publication to any directory, as well as supplementing the Scan Inventory database with new scans.
